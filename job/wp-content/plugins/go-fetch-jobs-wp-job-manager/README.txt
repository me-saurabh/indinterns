Instantly populate your [WP Job Manager](https://wpjobmanager.com/) site with jobs from the most popular job sites and/or job aggregators. This handy plugin fetches jobs from RSS feeds and imports them to your jobs database. Pick your favorite job site/job directory, look for the jobs RSS feed, paste it directly to *Go Fetch Jobs* and instantly get fresh jobs in your database!

To help you quickly getting fresh jobs from external sites, *Go Fetch Jobs* comes bundled with ready to use RSS feeds and detailed instructions on how to setup RSS feeds for job sites that provide them.

Easily categorize bulk job imports with job categories, job types, default custom fields values and expiry dates.

Besides the usual *Title* + *Description* + *Date* usually provided by RSS feeds, *Go Fetch Jobs* can also (optionally) extract and auto fill job companies logos, company names and locations, if that information is provided by the RSS feed.

It also comes with the ability to save import rules as templates so you can later recycle/re-use them for new imports.

Upgrade to a *Premium* plan to keep it automatically updated with fresh jobs added every day, through automatic schedules! (*)
